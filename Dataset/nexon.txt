Tata should lower the Nexon price and increase market share Tata Punch EV - 5-8 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 300 km range - 8-10 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 400 km range - 10-15 Lakhs Because, the affordability in lower range and availability in mid-range is important optional swappable range extender batteries would become a super hit like partnering with swappable battery stations
Need to increase mileage, battery capacity so range also increases, other features are good
 It gives me a range of 200-220 km on full AC
 If i use it in city and highways I get a range of 170-180 km if used strictly in city and small lanes with average speed not going above 30kms
 Approximate range according to my driving with AC ,music system etc always switched on
 It can't be only car to own due to under developing charging infrastructure and insufficient range
The best electronic car in India in this price range obsolete use of money Tata nexon is my favourite car because I love electronic cars 
Beautiful looks both interior and exterior, all are comfortable as like a medium range car
This car is the most value for money and not further any servicing charge pay on due to this car no effect on an environment This car range is very good which is 312km / charge This is the best car in the segment of tata motors Thank you
5-litre diesel engine with a top-class interior and comfortable on long route smooth and very tough body of tata as it's one of the best model tata has made I am not a person who just praise like that but it's an ultimate car muv in this range and I have
 The range are also so comfortable
 There is only two primary deterrents, I see, the range and available charging stations
 I expect at least a range of 400 km or charging stations at least at each of the toll plazas
 Price range and mileage is best in this class
 Its range is also good
 The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle
 You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220
 does not give the range as the company says
 The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge
 A realistic range of 210-240kms and depending on your driving style, you can get more
After reading all such reviews I would like to have this Electric miracle in 2027-28 when It would be more affordable to me in the range of 7-8 Lacs
Charging stations are less available and running range also not sufficient
Tata Nexon EV is one of the best affordable long-range electric vehicle available in India
I am highly disappointed by this car due to the range and behavior of the dealer
 I am driving this car daily for the last four months and very much upset by the real-world range
 Company claims a range of 300 but the real-world range is 140 km per charge with AC, and 150 km without AC
 But for my friends, i have daily commute of 70-80 KM and in the city, I am getting 220-230 range with a single charge
 Getting a range of 210km for 100%
 Normally I recharge it when it comes to 25% for which I used to get a range of 165 to 170kms (for 75%)
Tata Nexon EV is an innovative car, 5 stars crash rating safest, connected, 3 variants, the perfect car for sustainable mobility, good range, low maintenance, globally first A Benchmark
 The response time is excellent range per full charge is around 200km within the city
 The 30 KW battery is sufficient for city drive but there should have been a higher variant with 50Kw battery to cover up the range anxiety
 ARAI claim 312km per full charge, after a lot of research I found real-world range is 193km, a good driver will get 240km max
 Affordable range nearly 220-240 in reality
