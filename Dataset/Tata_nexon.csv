Review
Amazing car for daily usage please plan the charging stations for a long trip more than 200km and I suggest to buy this car and it is also attractive and stylish for its own way ..
"After driving Nexon EV for a few times, i feel there is much more factors that really makes Tata Succeed if they plan early. Tata should lower the Nexon price and increase market share Tata Punch EV - 5-8 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 300 km range - 8-10 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 400 km range - 10-15 Lakhs Because, the affordability in lower range and availability in mid-range is important optional swappable range extender batteries would become a super hit like partnering with swappable battery stations."
Really very Amazing experience.Just loved that car.So beautiful car ever i had seen.More spacious car and every one will be comfortable.
Yes you can go for electric vehicle because it has good average. it is about to 130 km running backup. The electric vehicle is pollution free. we must switch on to electric vehicle. because we must save the tree and nature. and we will save more money. The Tata Nexon EV looks very nice. The TATA group of company. it is very trusted company. this company has given me very quick service and maintenance. Thank you for electric car
Good car with good safety and comfort with all options..... .. . ..... ....
India's first safest and nature saver car. Amazing experience I felt. Easy gear controlling unit. Breaking and recharging battery while breaking is ultimate. Its all about futuristic car.
This nice car this future ka electric best in electric nexon EV no Diesel fuel no petrol is maintenance is battery level 8 year warranty karej warranty 5 year interior best looking
"Need to increase mileage, battery capacity so range also increases, other features are good. Tata cars are better than others. Servicing is also at best. I love Tata nexon, Harriers models."
"Love this car, very comfortable and pocket friendly. Not even bad for driving in heavy traffic. Legroom space is very spacious and comfortable seating. Powerful engine. Very good on off roading and suspension are too good. Best car in this budget."
"Bought Nexon EV on 28-5-21. Next day onwards I started having issues. Battery drops by 30-35% while parked. It wasn't fast charging also. Out of the 25 days, car was in showroom for around 10 days. We have spent our mental and physical energy in countless workshop visits, phone calls etc. Have been trying to contact Tata motors to replace the faulty vehicle, but every time they just repair something and send back. Our life has been a living hell since the day we bought this car. We got stranded thrice. Their customer service and technical team people don't pick up calls. we kept on calling. Finally 2 days back they replaced the battery pack, we thought our problems are over but no, this car won't let you sleep in peace. Now there are new issues. Even with 95% battery, its system is detecting 0 battery power. the system locked the car on limp mode. we are not able to move the car an inch, the steering wheel is locked. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR."
Tata Nexon EV. I can't explain in words. I simply say that Tata Nexon is the one company who should give us a good quality and excellent build quality. Tata company car are safe compare to others....
"Very nice car by security reasons, economic friendly car. We have very nice option in Indian car and in low maintenance. Buy this car."
Its a great car by Tata. Amazing performance. Hassle free charging (a good charging point is provided by Tata at home). Have used it for 5000 km since I bought it 3 months back. Haven't faced any issues. It gives me a range of 200-220 km on full AC. If i use it in city and highways I get a range of 170-180 km if used strictly in city and small lanes with average speed not going above 30kms.with full AC in May in Mumbai. so its a great car. Definitely a great buy..
Nice performance and looks. It is costly and it can be easily handled by new drivers and its maintenance can be easily available every where and the inner finishing is mind blowing and it is good car in this price.
Little bit complicated. Driving experience is next level Super looking super off-road capability also because it has 205 mm ground clearance. Less maintenance compare to IC engines. Everything is good not good great at this price segment Cons : is only on thing small battery capacity but it worthy at this price so we can't expect more Finally it's value for money car.
"It is amazing car. Its environment friendly and I love it. Guys if you want to stop the green house effect and reduce the pollution iI would recommend to buy this strong, beautiful, smart car that save your money and also environment."
"I bought Nexon EV 2 months ago. I was always interested in electric cars therefore after examining various product and waiting after launch of each one to judge the response, we finally decided to go ""vocal for local"" and buy Nexon EV. Other rivals are better in terms of all aspects but it doesn't make any sense to buy them because though they have cheaper running cost as every electric it costs the same as buying ICE car of same segment and spending on maintenance and fuel. On the other hand Nexon offers value for money package with decent features. Approximate range according to my driving with AC ,music system etc always switched on. 1. City : 200-220 km 2. Highway: 160-175km Pros : 1. It is a good looking car and has superior build quality. I had an accident and I did not use my insurance, vehicle was in good condition on the other hand opponent's car got crushed and had to tow his vehicle. 2. Has superb ride quality and insulation. Very peaceful to drive. Has more than enough ground clearance. 3. Interior quality is up to the mark and seats are extremely comfortable. 4.Performance is superb ,sports mode is addictive for torque lovers. 5.It is a perfect primary vehicle if you have secondary vehicle. 6. It has low running cost(1-1.5 Rs/km) and no dependency of fuel station. 7.Connected features offered gives peace of mind. Cons: 1. It can't be only car to own due to under developing charging infrastructure and insufficient range. 2. Range is not sufficient for long runs more than 160 km even if you have fast charger on the way as time spend on charging is too much. Eg (Pune- Kolhapur). 3. Infotainment system is a bit laggy, reverse camera and overall resolution of screen is not as good as other brands. 4. Due to extreme torque on offer wheel spin may eat your tyres early. Lack of much needed traction control system is evident."
This is the car with zero air pollution...this car loves nature as am I. Everyone should go for this car. 1 Indian manufacturers 2 eco friendly 3 pocket friendly not too big for parking space. kind of car with everything you want. Thank you Tata motors Ltd
"Recently purchased this car, driver comfort, providing powerful engine give freshness, leg space is awesome, boot space good, unique design Company should thing about the mileage that will better."
"One of the best cars I've Ever driven. It'll blow your mind. Pros: Silent, Build Quality, Ride Quality - Smooth and Supple Low Cost of ownership vis-à-vis both petrol and diesel cars. Interior looks feels great, Love with the white color The ICE car is rated 5 stars in the crash test - EV hasn't been tested yet though ,The color - looks mind-blowing in the real world. Green number plate - Value for money. I mean for your daily intra-city commute, why anyone would consider any other car."
"Overall Tata Nexon EV is value for money. Better ride quality and safety car of all this segment car. Tata Nexon is best forever against Eco sport, venue, brezza, polo, xuv300, s-cross. I think Nexon will be very good choice of every Indian who want to buy mid SUV. Every one before who want to buy mid SUV first should be take test drive of Tata nexon petrol Or Tata nexon EV."
"Best car i would say, Best in safety, performance.this car gives everything you want from a family car. Servicing cost is negligible,best in looks and my buying experience is gòod with TATA"
Servicing and maintenance on this car is price less. But... U must Buy this car in 2021 mis & last month. Next Generation is weating for you.. Tata motors Best Provide built Quality.
"Tata Nexon is very safest SUV , the driving experience was very awesome, you will really Love it, just go for it. Tata is our nation Pride,we should support our nation entrepreneur."
The best electronic car in India in this price range obsolete use of money Tata nexon is my favourite car because I love electronic cars .but charging station is not build in India.
Great work done by Tata motors We need more this kind of vehicles First big clap goes service and support team
"Ride is very comfortable, interiors are very premium Will do a max of 160 km on a single charge as against company's claim of 312 km, very huge gap Buy only if you have charging points at both locations (home and office) Pickup in sport mode is amazing but consumes a lot of battery Overall an expensive vehicle"
The cool car looks good and also saves a lot of money and also give a very silent drive and smooth too. U can buy it off you love silence and smooth drive.
Very nice and comfortable driving. Actually Tata Swadeshi I love Swadeshi items and I love really Tata cars special e Tata Nexon EV. And driving comfortable also there. Really mast vehicle
Very much expensive on-road price for Nexon ev xz plus variant in surat is 17 to 18 lakhs which is just nearly double against fossil cars. And expecting to run for 1 RS/KM vs 2.5 rs / km in cng (ertiga) the difference in amount will be equal when you drive daily near 200 km for 8 years. So why would anyone buy this nexon ev which we can't take on long drive and which is so much expensive instead will go for ertiga vxi cng.
"The cons have been found is that it should be both electric & fuel type major part of the country is not covered with that much electricity. If you make this variant to riding at all fuel type like CNG, petrol, diesel and electric. Then this model became the biggest blockbuster in car industry. Make sure you have both options like electric & petrol or electric & CNG, electric and diesel."
"comfort, well breaking ,comfort setting also driving.Really very nice well design easy to access control.Beautiful looks both interior and exterior, all are comfortable as like a medium range car."
Very nice performance this car very good spece and best to long drive also and the engine is very good and better to easily drive and very good milege i am so Happy to drive this car
Nice and very comfortable car interior comfort is relaxing and outer exterior is aggressive design are very cool and performance of engine is to good eco-friendly car in budget segment good to buy ...
"There are 5 ev available in the Indian market, as of now. 25 more are expected to be launched within the next 18 months. If you go by listed expectations, 11 cars will be over 30 lakhs. Of the rest, Tata is expected to hog the limelight. Leading the charge is the Nexon ev with great power, high battery life and all features you would want in your car. I expect it to beat all the competition hollow. It blends power, battery life, price, features and size superbly. If I had my way, I would make all my friends sell their present ICE and buy this."
Superb amazing car i like this car and world best car for tata Nexon ev car I want to buy this car for future and i say to all person this car is very very beautiful and amazing I like this car
Good acceleration from a standing start... No issues in city traffic driving as the regenerative braking adds power to the battery. Charges from the normal 15A socket at home. Running cost is around Re 1 per Km. It is a bit pricey but in the long run it's worth it.
The car is amazing and it worth buying. It has all latest features of high quality products like inner and extremely comfortable. The drive is too good with High way and rough roads. Value for money.
"Yeah..!! It's a silent moon, I have experienced it. I looked it from a distance someone was already seated on driving seat. When I asked to crank the engine he replied ""it's already in one condition"" it shocked me, there was pin-drop silence inside car, not a single instance of vibration. It was really wow filling.. I took a test drive, smooth start-up, great grade ability. Instant cooling, awesome music. Ultimately I should say, it's a great moon to have in your firmament."
I am proud to TATA MOTOR because we are INDIAN and we love our country we are glad to see our Indian cars. So I am very happy to see this and Naxon EV is amazing and interesting.
price high ..charging a double price for placing battery and not reducing price for removing parts which are in non-electric Nexon. tata is charging money of non-electric Nexon + battery ..which is not good..if they want to charge like this ..they have to also provide petrol engine also..in emergency that can be used ..they can provide very small petrol engine which can be used in emergency the parts which are in non-electric Nexon are not less in this electric the least price of the model starts should from 9.5 lakh
"Public please don't buy tata cars market rate full money loss, not original parts an available tata motors company fraud to don't purchase tata cars total worst cars I'm buying Tata vista car total body rust under body water wash worst work west service worst but cost price heavy cost of Tata motors"
"Yes, it is indeed a good car but some of the things I would like to highlight are when the car is being charged from a fast charger it stops in the middle of the road by its own and comes to neutral by itself and it takes minutes or even you should come out u should lock the unlock for it to start again and sometimes it stops in traffic and this is even more horrible if u are not able to start or move in the middle.so tata should look into it very soon."
"Awesome experience through out the journey with Tata ev, exspecially the performance almost used 500 kms, getting better efficiency and most importantly safety features.. Thanks tata"
This car is the most value for money and not further any servicing charge pay on due to this car no effect on an environment This car range is very good which is 312km / charge This is the best car in the segment of tata motors Thank you
The car look is very nice and Body look gorgeous Performance-wise Nexon is best in its segment with an engine of a 1.5-litre diesel engine with a top-class interior and comfortable on long route smooth and very tough body of tata as it's one of the best model tata has made I am not a person who just praise like that but it's an ultimate car muv in this range and I have
I planned to buy this car.. I love Ratan Tata and his support to India so I planed to buy best Indian make. Best choice I feel. I saw feedback about this car and looks completely satisfied.
This is unbelievable and this is so amazing awesome luxurious and cool design and safest car Tata company in Indian company and manufacture good quality car and I like this card and in future i'm purchase this car and car colour combination is awesome very beautiful and like Tata company all variants of car .
"Nice electronic car but need more charging stations in all over india , cost are too high, compare to diesel 8lacks high which is a huge amount , excellent sun roof , normal charging time 9hrs its long duration.. thanks"
Car is bit higher on price but is fuel efficiency of EV is big plus. 8 years of battery warranty and awesome performance make it perfect. Interior comfort and external design is awesome.
As per I have driven the tata Nexon XM petrol car its has very smooth driving freely with better mileage than other companies cars ...and excellent steering ...will always buy a car made by tata company
"Tata is pursuing best last 4-5years and continually improve in all segments. This electric vehicle best, especially those people are travelling 80-100km total distance both. This vehicle environment free and petrol and diesel-free. Charging points will be increased in India by the government. My request."
"This is the Best electric Car in Market , Close your eyes and just buy it. Hyundai kona electric is almost 10lakh rup expensive than Nexon. Built quality - Best Boot space - More than other competitors Power - more than other competitors Average - more than other competitors Service center - More than other competitors You can do charging at various accessible places."
"Tata Nexon ev car has amazing features,and this is affordable luxury car in india,anyone can drive this car,this car is best and safest for offroading and family touring & traveling,this car has airbag and best braking system ,this car is more powerful and smart car in future for anyone .thank you.."
Very nice car it is amazing at this price you get screen very nice you purchase it is nice car performance is nice mileage is low and price but nice car
When I saw the nexon ev I like it so much So nice look and features . The range are also so comfortable. We used car daily run 150 km one side . The colour of car also so beautiful
"Back then.,when tesla was trying...it was hard to believe evs would be the future... that too in India not even close. now with a handful of cars with EV badging. Indian manufacture(Tesla). Tata takes a bow."
Basically you will get solid built quality by tata As usual and first indian electric car . it's an electric car so maintenance will surely going to be low. Nimble clutch and solid driving performance on high speed you will fell more confidence
"Superd car each and everything so good, it's have powerful engine, design is too good, i have vary Good experience with driving this car, I love this car, it's tata best and best car, no one car have compared with this car"
"The car is really fun to drive. It charges quite fast! 0-80% in just 60 min (fast charging) 0-100% in 9hrs in normal AC Charger. Moreover, the top variant which I drove was well equipped with features and materials were good as well. Tata has done a really good job with the Nexon EV and the very punchy performance."
"I had a test drive with EV middle variant. You want to believe me, the experience was mind-blowing. Maybe because I have driven petrol and diesel cars only. This was my first EV experience. There is only two primary deterrents, I see, the range and available charging stations. I expect at least a range of 400 km or charging stations at least at each of the toll plazas.. in any case, I am planning to buy it in future. And price as well could be reduced a bit more.."
Took a test drive found it thriller 'but the cost is too high should be less than 10 lakhs. Hope Tata will come with the same low-cost product that will fetch more customers and me too.
"Mind-blowing pickup, smooth ride, killer looks, low maintenance, I want to give 10 stars out of 5. Harman speakers is amazing, it should have been little louder but don't think its less. With connecting app u can turn on the ac from a phone and also start the engine, switch on headlamps and much more. It's totally worth it don't hesitate to buy Nexon ev. Buy the high-end model, it's totally worth it."
TATA Indigo and zest was our previous experience we love India and TATA is Indian so our preference lies here PRICES r affordable Long drive or short drive very fantastic Looks like a car and nothing else servicing fantastic Require still soft smooth and light feeling when travelling
I have loved the car too much. I suggest you buy the car. The car design is the most attractive and stylish. The car is full of features. The car is very smooth and noiseless. The car is pollution less.
The new Tata nexon segment of electric version till date the cheapest SUV however if we look petrol/diesel version of this car there is a huge difference in price if Tata lauch electric car with any other different more beautiful model so we cannot compare the price with other version .
Car is very good but the price is very high if it's come to under 10L is value for money.if the price gets a little bit cheaper than the middle-class family also buy this car all good
"This car is good by driving performance but the price is too high. If we compare same segment in other companies like Hyundai, Suzuki we will get more or less same features in less price. So the overall car is good but tata is charging a higher price."
It's an amazing option in this class Had a wonderful experience with this version Durability and maintenance is the key to select a vehicle. Price range and mileage is best in this class. Go for it
To sum up the test Drive It was quite fulfilling and exciting. The car behaved much like an ev should. Was great to drive and Handle. Drove it at both Normal and sports and was really a punch to pack. Also charges at 15Amp in 8 hours (100%) Really an Indian thought. Really thrilled that an Indian Manufacturer has achieved This much. Way to go.
"THE ONE AND ONLY CAR WITH ALL FEATURES LIKE SAFETY, LUXURIES, PERFORMANCE, BATTERY BACKUP AND THE CAR IS WORTH 100%, IT ALSO INCLUDES SPORT MODE, LIGHT IN THE GEAR SELECTION WILL NOT APPEAR on SUN"
"REALLY LOVED IT I THINK THIS IS THE BEST ELECTRIC CAR AMONG ALL CARS NOW IN MARKET TATA HAD DONE A GREAT JOB , 100% VALUE OF MONEY AND SAFETY OF THE CAR IS REALLY AWESOME THANKS FOR TATA"
I love to buy an alectric car designed by Tata Nixon in India..I need to drive a new experience in an electric cars...that will save my money in our day to day life ...by using Fuel .in now a days. EV plays to achieve a vital role in our upcoming day to day life..n it also fulfill clear environment in all around us..

Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.Read More

Very nice car it looks very awesome and its performance is wonderful. It's interior is very nice.
Very good Jarvis. The most efficient in this segment in India. Tata Nexon is one of the most powerful 35kw batteries.

Otherwise, could have been a major...Read More"
