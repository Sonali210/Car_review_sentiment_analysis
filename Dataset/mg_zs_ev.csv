Review
"ZS EV is one of the premium EVs in India, with more efficiency and reliability than any other EVs in India at an affordable range. The design of the car increases the road presence and makes an amazing grip on the road which boosts the performance quality of the car. The power in the car is fun. More power than 140 bhp, Adas(at least level 2). Specified ground clearance. AWD, rear ac vent. More feature. Disliking interiors could be more premium than 2021. The 2022 front grill looks unattractive. The lagging in infotainment."
