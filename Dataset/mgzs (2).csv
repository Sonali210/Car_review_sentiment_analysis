Review
"Really love how MG has kept the interiors classy with high quality! Replace the badges with the big 3 and you won't notice the difference. Worth the price IMO and essentially makes the Astor look like a steal!

Agree with the tyre pressure setting. Have turned it down to 35psi on the Version 2.0 of the ZS EV and it's super comfortable at that setting.
"While it might be the most sorted of the limited no. of mainstream EVs available in India today, the ZS is definitely not affordable for the masses at its current price tag of 23-27 lac on-road (Bangalore), especially as an electric car. A miniscule percentage of households will have an EV as their primary/only car, where the ZS fits nicely. However, for majority of EV buyers, it would be their second or third car, and this is when the high price tag of the ZS plays spoilsport. In this scenario, the Nexon EV (despite all its quirks and QC issues) appears as a much more viable option for Indian middle class car buyers. Heck, I have seen more Nexon EVs share garages with Mercs, Porsches, BMWs and the likes, as compared to ZS EVs.

"I test-drove the pre-facelift car and found it to be an excellent city car. The only negative point of this car is lack of under thigh support at the back. I was genuinely considering this to replace my 9.5 year old Yeti. But the knees up sitting position at the back is the main reason my dad turned this car down. Is it same with the facelift car as well?
"
"ne thing I noticed is that there's no frunk! The pic showing the open bonnet is really disappointing - such a loose jumble of component boxes. Did it not even occur to the designers to create a frunk!? It's one of the signature perks of owning an EV, for heaven's sake! Probably because this car is adapted from an ICE platform?
"
"I like the Astor's front end quite a bit. Given that the facelifted ZS and the Astor share so much with each other, I am hoping that some smart chap comes up with a way to fit the Astor's front panel to the ZS!
"
"What I was trying to say is - we as a nation have quite some ground to cover when it comes to EVs being the primary/only car in a garage for the masses - relatively higher cost, sparse charging infra (though it is catching up at a rapid pace), etc. Given all these factors, more people will put their money on a relatively lower-priced car like the Nexon as opposed to the ZS.
"
"I had set the seat to a low-ish position, which I felt most comfortable in. Despite being a somewhat tall 6' 2"", from my driving position, I couldn't see the bottom 1/4th of the instrument cluster. Now this is critical since all the important stats are displayed in the bottom section including the KERS state and the battery percentage. I had to half sit up from my position to catch a glimpse of these important stats.
"
"The cluster fonts are way too small to be usable. All important information (incl. the aforesaid KERS position and battery %age) is displayed in such small font that your eyes have to linger on the display to decipher what they are saying.
"
"For those considering an EV as their second/third car can possibly wait for one from MG/Hyundai (or a Tata Punch EV may be) in the price range of 12 - 14 lakhs, albeit with a smaller battery pack, in the next couple of years. The existing ICE car in the garage can take care of the long trips while the EV can be the run-about.
"
"The ZS-EV does look like a compelling proposition for those with mostly in-city driving and highway runs of say 150 KM on each side, or upto 300KM each side if one is guaranteed overnight charging facility. My highway runs to my holiday cottage in the hills are like 520KM each way and EV is not an answer, unless I plan overnight halts at hotels with charging capabilities. I also hate to take forced breaks at charging stations over breakfast etc. as I have variable start times on most trips and it is hard to plan the trips too cleanly. Many times, you are returning on a Sunday afternoon, doing an 8 hour drive and must be at work Monday morning, and cannot afford unplanned stops due to charging stations being unavailable etc. Even if one planned an overnight halt for charging, then again, with unreliable power, I always worry of they had a blackout what would I do the next morning
"
"I wish the EVs like MG ZS would be designed with battery swapping facility like we are speaking of now for 2 and 3 wheelers in the city. This would provide a lot more peace of mind, as the experience is essentially like pulling into a fuel station and topping off your tank. I guess this would require a large amount of standardization across manufacturers who are already off to different specs, design and sizes for the battery.
"
"I didn't take the opportunity to do these trips when I was younger and I regret that every day. As middle age hits, there are so many responsibilities that long drives and long vacations seem to be unattainable. Maybe I should look forward to retirement then
"
"I don't think that anyone would drive 520 kms in one go without taking a break unless one is undertaking a specific test. With EVs one has to plan the journey and infrastructure is coming up faster than before. The way I see it is that it allows for a more enjoyable road trip with enforcing breaks for refreshment for both the car and self which in the long run is a good thing.
"
"The ground clearance of 177 mm worries me and scares me. It may scrape speed breakers and get hit on potholes. I already booked the vehicle 4 months back and should get a delivery in a couple of months. In fact I have also booked the Nexon long range. I am in a dilemma as to which one to pick. My basic priority is good ground clearance which becomes even more important during monsoons. Kindly enlighten and advice.
