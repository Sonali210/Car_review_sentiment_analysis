Pretty good car, smooth as a glider fast car, instant pickup and the range in one charge is also pretty good as well, so we can go more miles, a catchy car grab our eye balls everyone wants to ride this
This car is a perfect, modern and stylish car one thing I like about the car it's is long-range and is safe and it so eye-catching a man just cross the road just to ask which Hyundai car is this lastly I love this car I hope you do thanks for your time
 And I greatly appreciate Hyundai's innovation in bringing electric cars but the price for this is too much and even if the gst gets reduced it will come about 20l but there are many competitors in that range except for the electric transmission
One of the best EV car available in India with very good range
 The price is also the best according to the standards of the car and such a long range drive in one charge
 Real-life range of 330km on a full charge
 Make more products like these in a good range of price which is affordable for all
The car offers reasonable performance in this range
